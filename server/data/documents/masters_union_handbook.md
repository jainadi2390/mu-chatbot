## 1. Note from the Director
Dear Students,

Congratulations on making it to Masters' Union! You are part of a highly selective group—among the top percentile of applicants this year. Getting here wasn't easy, and you should be proud of what you've already accomplished.

But let me be honest: getting into Masters' Union is not the destination. It's the starting line. What this place offers you is a front-row seat—an environment designed to push you, challenge you, and open doors you may not even have imagined yet. But to make the most of this opportunity, you will need to stay sharp, stay hungry, and stay on your toes.

The curriculum will be rigorous, the pace intense, and the expectations high—because we believe that's exactly what prepares you for the real world of technology, business, and leadership.

This journey won't be easy. But it will be transformative—if you choose to fully lean in. That means asking questions, taking initiative, challenging ideas, and making the most of every interaction—whether it's with faculty, your peers, visiting leaders, or the broader Masters' Union ecosystem.

Let me also share a few principles and practices that guide how we run the UG Programme:

### We Always Lead with a Student-First Mindset
At the core of everything we do is a simple principle: do what is right for the student. Every policy, every class, every guest session, every initiative—our single most important filter is how it will impact your learning, growth, career, and long-term success.

### You Can—and Should—Reach Out
Approachability is something I take very seriously. If you have feedback, concerns, ideas, or just want to share what's on your mind, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Whether in person or over email, I may not always respond instantly, but I am listening—and your input truly matters. This is your programme as much as it is ours, and the more open the dialogue, the better the outcomes for all of us. If you require my direct attention, please email me at (swati.ganeti@mastersunion.org) and keep ugstudentaffairs@mastersunion.org in cc.

### We're Constantly Improving the Machine
A lot happens behind the scenes to make your experience smooth—from academics and career services to immersions, events, and student life. We're working hard to ensure all our internal teams—curriculum, careers, operations, student affairs—are tightly aligned so things work seamlessly for you.

### You'll See Us Listening and Sharing More
Over the coming terms, we'll begin rolling out culture surveys to get your honest inputs on how the programme is running, how the environment feels, and what we can do better. The plan is not just to gather feedback—but to share the findings publicly and discuss them transparently in quarterly town halls. We'll read the results together and talk openly about what's working and what's not.

As we begin this journey together, remember: you're not just here to learn—you're here to build. Build your skills, your network, your confidence, and your future. Masters' Union will give you the platform. But how far you go will be determined by how much you show up, engage, and push your own boundaries.

I'm excited to see what you all create. Let's make it count.

Regards,
Swati Ganeti
Director, UG Programmes, Masters' Union
